#$ TITLE:  Tune defaults for Basic 4.3 TUNES
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: TUNE
#$ STATUS: OFFICIAL
#$ KEYWORDS: defaults, reset, tune, pid, basic, default
#$ AUTHOR: Betaflight
#$ DESCRIPTION: Resets all Basic 4.3 Tune category parameters to defaults
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Overwrites all settings mentioned below to defaults.  The User cannot retain their previous values.
#$ DESCRIPTION: WARNING: Tune authors must explicitly set these values to something other than default, if needed for the tune.
#$ DESCRIPTION: DOES NOT reset rates, filters, rc_smoothing, and many other parameters.
#$ PRIORITY: 0
#$ HIDDEN: true
